# Restaurant AQA framework

End-to-end tests for the Green & Tasty restaurant application: Reqnroll (Gherkin) + TUnit + Playwright for .NET, with the Screenplay pattern.

Guidance for extending the suite (writing Gherkin, steps, Screenplay, test data, working with an AI assistant) is in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## Run the tests

```bash
cp .env.example .env        # then fill in your own values (see "Configuration")
dotnet build
dotnet run --no-build -- --report-trx                                     # run entire suite
dotnet run --no-build -- --treenode-filter "/*/*/*/*[Category=level-1]"    # run Level 1 Group Pre-Order tests
dotnet run --no-build -- --treenode-filter "/*/*/*/*[Category=smoke]"      # run smoke tests
```

Everything a run produces lands in `TestResults/`: the TUnit report and TRX, the Reqnroll report in `reqnroll/`, and Playwright traces in `traces/` (open one with `npx playwright show-trace <file>.zip`).

Some scenarios are expected to fail (`@known-defect`, bugs in the application) or are skipped (`@wip`, no admin account configured). That is intentional.

## Quality gates

| Where | What runs |
|---|---|
| Git hooks (local) | `pre-commit`: `dotnet format` check and Gherkin lint on staged files · `commit-msg`: Conventional Commits · `pre-push`: build with analyzers |
| `aqa-quality.yml` | on every push and pull request: no generated files tracked, format, build (warnings are errors), Gherkin lint, test discovery |
| `aqa-tests.yml` | the scenarios themselves, nightly and on demand (Actions → AQA Tests → Run workflow) |

Enable the hooks once per clone, from the repository root:

```bash
dotnet tool restore --tool-manifest aqa/restaurant-aqa-framework/.config/dotnet-tools.json
git config core.hooksPath aqa/restaurant-aqa-framework/.husky
```

The hooks only act on commits and pushes that touch `aqa/restaurant-aqa-framework`. Gherkin lint needs Node.js.

## Configuration

There is no shared environment and no committed `.env`: copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it in with the data of **your own** deployment (see "Testing your own deployment"). `.env` is git-ignored; never commit it.

Settings come from `.env` or real environment variables (variables win):

| Setting | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `UI_URL` | where the frontend is served |
| `API_URL` | base URL of the backend API, including the stage (for example `…/develop`) |
| `WAITER_USERNAME`, `WAITER_PASSWORD` | a waiter account that already exists in the environment under test |
| `TESTTABLE_ID`, `TESTTABLE_WAITER_*` | a table and the waiter assigned to it (only for scenarios that need them) |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | an admin account; without it the admin scenarios are skipped |

The full list, with defaults, is in `.env.example`.

## Testing your own deployment

### If you deployed the backend / frontend / DevOps homework

1. `cp .env.example .env` and set `UI_URL` and `API_URL` to your deployment (API URL includes the stage, for example `…/develop`).
2. Waiters cannot be created by signing up, so create a waiter (and, for the admin scenarios, an admin) in *your* environment and put its credentials in `WAITER_*` / `ADMIN_*`. Optionally add a table and its assigned waiter (`TESTTABLE_*`).
3. Run `dotnet build` and a small slice first (`--treenode-filter "/*/*/*/*[Category=level-1]"` or `--treenode-filter "/*/*/*/*[Category=smoke]"`).

### CI on your own public repository

Publish your work in your own public Git repository (the link is the deliverable). Workflows are disabled in a fresh fork until you enable them. Add the same values under Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:

- **Variables:** `AQA_UI_URL`, `AQA_API_URL`, `AQA_TESTTABLE_ID`
- **Secrets:** `AQA_WAITER_USERNAME`, `AQA_WAITER_PASSWORD`, `AQA_ADMIN_USERNAME`, `AQA_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `AQA_TESTTABLE_WAITER_USERNAME`, `AQA_TESTTABLE_WAITER_PASSWORD`

`aqa-quality.yml` runs on every push and pull request; `aqa-tests.yml` (nightly and on demand) tests whatever those variables point at. Never put credentials in the repository, in `.env.example` or in test code.

## Presetup instructions

This framework contains PlaywriteInstaller script so you don't need to setup it manually.
For full BDD highlighting in your IDE you may need to install Reqnroll extension https://docs.reqnroll.net/latest/ide-integrations/index.html
To start the Playwright code generator open Powershell in the framework directory and enter the line:
```bash
bin/Debug/net10.0/playwright.ps1 codegen "<your UI_URL or the public site you test>"
```
Build first so `playwright.ps1` exists. The URL is optional.
